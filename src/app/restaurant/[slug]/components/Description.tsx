        Inspired by the warmth and vibrancy of Jamaica’s culture and people,
        Chubby&apos;s Jamaican Kitchen is a take on traditional Jamaican cooking
        balanced with relevant culinary twists. Co-founded as a passion project
        by Gusto 54 founder Janet Zuccarini and Angela Lawrence, Gusto 54’s
        Chief Culture Officer, Chubby’s is a celebration of their long
        friendship, and their love and respect for the island’s food and all the
        amazing Jamaican cooks they know. Located in a circa-1890 row house
        re-envisioned by Partisans Architects and interior designer Wendy
        Haworth, Chubby’s boasts two floors of seating, two bars, and two
        outdoor patios. It melds old and new, inside and out to create a
        transporting dining experience complete with delicious Caribbean
        cooking, eclectic design and soulful hospitality. Chubby&apos;s is also
        a Michelin Guide CA - rated restaurant.
